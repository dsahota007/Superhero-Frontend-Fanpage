        <br>"The Amazing Spider-Man" introduces us to Garfield's Peter Parker, a brilliant high school student who gains superhuman abilities after being bitten by a genetically-altered spider. He embarks on a journey to uncover the truth about his parents' disappearance while simultaneously embracing his responsibilities as Spider-Man. The film explores Peter's relationship with Gwen Stacy (Emma Stone) and his conflict with Dr. Curt Connors (Rhys Ifans), who transforms into the villainous Lizard. "The Amazing Spider-Man 2" delves deeper into Peter's life as he continues to balance his duties as Spider-Man and his relationship with Gwen. He faces new challenges in the form of Electro (Jamie Foxx), a dangerous adversary with electric powers, and a childhood friend, Harry Osborn (Dane DeHaan), who becomes the Green Goblin. The film delves into themes of power, responsibility, and the impact of choices on both hero and villain. Andrew Garfield's portrayal brought a fresh take on the character, emphasizing his intelligence, wit, and emotional complexity. While there were plans for further sequels in this series, as of my last update, the franchise took a different direction with the introduction of Tom Holland as Spider-Man in the Marvel Cinematic Universe.<br><br><br><br>"The Amazing Spider-Man" and its sequel "The Amazing Spider-Man 2" received video game adaptations that allowed players to step into the role of Spider-Man in an open-world New York City environment. The games were developed by Beenox and published by Activision. These video games aimed to capture the essence of Andrew Garfield's Spider-Man by providing players with the opportunity to swing through the city, engage in combat with various foes, and complete missions that mirrored the events of the films. Players could also explore the open world, uncover collectibles, and engage in side activities.

        <span class="big-Title">The Amazing Spider-Man (2012)</span><br><br><br>"The Amazing Spider-Man" (2012) follows the journey of Andrew Garfield's Peter Parker, a brilliant and somewhat isolated high school student with a mysterious past. After being bitten by a genetically-altered spider, he gains remarkable superhuman abilities. Eager to uncover the truth about his parents' disappearance, Peter embarks on a quest that leads him to the research of Dr. Curt Connors (Rhys Ifans), a scientist seeking to regenerate his lost limb using reptile DNA. As Peter's life intertwines with that of Connors, he finds himself grappling with the responsibilities of his newfound powers and the desire to protect the city as the iconic superhero, Spider-Man. Additionally, Peter's feelings for Gwen Stacy (Emma Stone), Connors' intern, deepen, leading to a romantic relationship. However, Connors' experiments result in him transforming into the monstrous Lizard, setting the stage for a climactic battle that forces Peter to confront his own identity and determine the kind of hero he wants to become. "The Amazing Spider-Man" reimagines Spider-Man's origin story with a fresh take, focusing on Peter's personal struggles and his evolution into a crime-fighting vigilante.

        "The Amazing Spider-Man 2" (2014) continues Andrew Garfield's portrayal of Peter Parker as he navigates the challenges of being both a college student and the web-slinging hero. The film delves into Peter's complex relationship with Gwen Stacy (Emma Stone), balancing his love for her with the constant danger of his life as Spider-Man. <br><br> As he grapples with Gwen's departure for a safer future, new threats emerge in the form of Electro (Jamie Foxx), an electrically-charged adversary, and Harry Osborn (Dane DeHaan), Peter's childhood friend who succumbs to a hereditary curse and becomes the Green Goblin. These villains force Peter to confront the fine line between heroism and the responsibilities he holds both to himself and those he loves. The film delves into the impact of choices, the challenges of power, and the ever-present danger that Peter faces as both a protector and a young man trying to find his path. "The Amazing Spider-Man 2" weaves together action, emotion, and the complexities of heroism, resulting in a compelling exploration of the human side of the iconic superhero.

        <span class="big-Title">Spider-Man: No Way Home (2021)</span><br><br><br>Garfield reprised his role as Spidey in the box office juggernaut Spider-Man: No Way Home alongside early-aughts Peter Parker, Tobey Maguire. The pair joined current franchise star Tom Holland in a reunion that had been widely-rumored, but vehemently denied by those involved. Garfield previously told Variety that he “wasn not expecting to ever have a conversation about potentially playing Peter Parker” again. <br><br><br>He explained, “I felt very excited to just to be a fan again. But I got this call from [producer] Amy Pascal and [Marvel Studios chief] Kevin Feige and [director] Jon Watts with this idea. It was immediately undeniable. It sounded incredibly fun, incredibly spiritual—trippy and thematically interesting. On a base level, as a Spider-Man fan, just the idea of seeing three Spider-Men in the same frame was enough.”

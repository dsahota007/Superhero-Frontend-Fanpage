<div class="andrew-mainPage-info"><p> <br>In 2012, Garfield made his debut as Spider-Man in "The Amazing Spider-Man." This film served as a modern retelling of Peter Parker's origin story, focusing on his high school years and the transformation into the web-slinging hero. Garfield brought a youthful energy to the character, capturing both Peter's intelligence and his struggles as a teenager coming to terms with his new abilities. The film's visual effects and action sequences showcased Garfield's embodiment of Spider-Man's acrobatics and web-swinging skills.

    The success of the first film led to a sequel, "The Amazing Spider-Man 2," released in 2014. <br><br><br> Garfield reprised his role, delving deeper into Peter Parker's personal journey as he faced new challenges, including a formidable set of villains. Garfield's chemistry with Emma Stone, who portrayed Gwen Stacy, added emotional depth to the story, and their on-screen romance resonated with audiences.
    
    While both films were commercially successful, opinions among fans and critics were divided. Some appreciated Garfield's portrayal for its authenticity and emotional depth, while others felt that the rebooted series was too soon after the previous "Spider-Man" trilogy. </p>

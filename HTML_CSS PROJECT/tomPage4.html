        <span class="big-Title">Captain America: Civil War (2016)</span><br><br>Tom Holland's Spider-Man makes his highly anticipated debut in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU). The film portrays Spider-Man's first appearance as a young, agile, and enthusiastic hero who is still coming to terms with his powers and responsibilities. Tony Stark/Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr.) recruits Peter Parker, a high school student from Queens, New York, to join his team in the escalating conflict between the Avengers. This sets the stage for Spider-Man's involvement in the larger superhero world, as well as his connection to Tony Stark, who provides him with a technologically advanced suit.
        Holland's portrayal of Spider-Man in "Civil War" captures the character's youthful energy and charm. The film offers a glimpse into Peter Parker's life as a regular teenager, balancing schoolwork, his relationship with Aunt May (Marisa Tomei), and his newly acquired superhero identity. The battle scenes showcase Spider-Man's acrobatics, web-swinging abilities, and quick-witted banter, marking a departure from previous cinematic iterations.
        While Spider-Man's appearance in "Civil War" is relatively brief, it leaves a lasting impact on both the character and the audience. The film sets the foundation for his continued development and his eventual role as a central figure in the MCU's subsequent phases.

        <span class="big-Title">Spider-Man: Homecoming</span><br><br>In "Spider-Man: Homecoming" (2017), Tom Holland's Spider-Man takes center stage in his first standalone film within the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU). The movie offers a fresh perspective on the character, focusing on the challenges of being a teenage superhero while juggling the demands of high school life. Set shortly after the events of "Captain America: Civil War," Peter Parker is eager to prove himself as a capable hero under the mentorship of Tony Stark/Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr.). However, he is confined to local crime-fighting and struggles to balance his responsibilities as Spider-Man with his desire to lead a normal life as a student.
        The film introduces Adrian Toomes/The Vulture (Michael Keaton) as the main antagonist. Toomes is a salvage worker who turns to a life of crime after losing a contract to Stark's company. The Vulture's high-tech wings and criminal activities pose a significant threat to Peter's city and his loved ones. "Homecoming" focuses on Peter's growth as he learns the hard way that being a hero involves more than just fancy technology and flashy battles. His friendship with Ned Leeds (Jacob Batalon) provides moments of levity, and his crush on classmate Liz (Laura Harrier) adds an endearing element of teenage romance.
